# pe-security-analyzer
PE Security Analyzer is a Python-based tool for auditing the security posture of Windows PE (Portable Executable) files such as .dll and .exe. It inspects security features like ASLR, DEP, CFG, SafeSEH, and digital signature presence. It also attempts basic obfuscation detection and exports the analysis results to a CSV report.
